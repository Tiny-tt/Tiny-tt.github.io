Abstract: A Poisson regression based on eigenvector spatial ﬁltering (ESF) is proposed to evaluate the ﬂood risk in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in China. Regression analysis is employed to model the relationship between the frequency of ﬂood alarming events observed by hydrological stations and hazard-causing factors from 2005 to 2012. Eight factors, including elevation (ELE), slope (SLO), elevation standard deviation (ESD), river density (DEN), distance to mainstream (DIST), NDVI, annual mean rainfall (RAIN), mean annual maximum of three-day accumulated precipitation (ACC) and frequency of extreme rainfall (EXE) are selected and integrated into a GIS environment for the identiﬁcation of ﬂood-prone basins. ESF-based Poisson regression (ESFPS) can ﬁlter out the spatial autocorrelation. The methodology includes construction of a spatial weight matrix, testing of spatial autocorrelation, decomposition of eigenvectors, stepwise selection of eigenvectors and calculation of regression coeﬃcients. Compared with the pseudo R squared obtained by PS (0.56), ESFPS exhibits better ﬁtness with a value of 0.78, which increases by approximately 39.3%. ESFPS identiﬁes six signiﬁcant factors including ELE, DEN, EXE, DIST, ACC and NDVI, in which ACC and NDVI are the ﬁrst two main factors. The method can provide decision support for ﬂood risk relief and hydrologic station planning.
