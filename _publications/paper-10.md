Abstract: PM2.5 concentrations are commonly estimated using geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, but these models may suffer from multi-collinearity and over-focus on local feature problems. To overcome these shortcomings, a self-adaptive bandwidth eigenvector spatial filtering (SA-ESF) model utilizing the golden section search (GO-ESF) and genetic algorithm (GA-ESF) was proposed. The SA-ESF model was applied to estimate ground PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China both seasonally and annually from December 2015 to November 2016 using remotely sensing data, factory locations, and road networks. The results of the original eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF), GO-ESF, GA-ESF, and GWR models show that the GA-ESF model offers better performance and exhibits a better average adjusted R2 which is 26.6%, 15.3%, and 10.8% higher than for the ESF, GO-ESF, and GWR models, respectively. We next calculated stochastic site indicators that can describe characteristics of regional concentration from interpolated concentration maps derived from the GA-ESF and GWR models. The concentration maps and stochastic site indicators point to major differences in the PM2.5 concentrations in mountainous areas. There are notably high concentrations in those areas using the GWR model, in contrast with the GA-ESF results, indicating that there may be overfitting problems using the GWR model. Overall, the proposed SA-ESF model with the genetic algorithm technique can capture both global and local features and achieve promising results.
